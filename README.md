Today, heart failure diseases affect more people worldwide than other autoimmune conditions. Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs) affect the heart and obstruct blood flow through the blood vessels. Chronic ailments in CVD include heart disease (heart attack), cerebrovascular diseases (strokes), congestive heart failure, and many more pathologies. Worldwide, CVDs kill around 17 million a year, and death rates due to heart diseases have increased after the COVID-19 pandemic.

CVDs commonly occur when the heart fails to supply blood under normal conditions, leading to high blood pressure, diabetes, chest pain, or other cardiac disorders. Initially, hospitals use regular tools like ECGs to determine and evaluate the stage of the disease. Better technologies like MCGs help in detecting these diseases when they are in an early stage. However, such devices and technologies are not just expensive and unfit for smaller clinics for heart disease diagnosis but also time-consuming and sensitive to tangential causes. Thus, technicians and clinicians would greatly benefit if there was an autonomous system in place that could perform a test for heart disease detection and warn of CVD risk at an early stage. With AI entering every other industry with the advance of computer science, medical science perhaps has the vastest scope of need and use for artificial intelligence solutions -- especially in developing countries.

Generally, the major causes of heart disease are diabetes, obesity, unhealthy diet, overweight, excessive alcohol use, and physical inactivity. The biological factors affected by these causes, along with age, thalassemia, chest pain, and preexisting conditions, also contribute significantly. Several datasets have been proposed to comprehensively train a machine learning model based on the several features and parameters identified by experts in heart disease prediction or heart disease detection. Let's look at the best Heart Disease Prediction Datasets to use.

We have used 4 Algorithms to know which algorithm is best:
Logistic Regression,Random Forest,Ann,XGBoost..
From that we came to know that Random Forest has best accuracy
